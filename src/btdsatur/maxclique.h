/* This C++ source code of a DSatur-based backtracking algorithm for graph
  colouring has been adapted from the C code of Joseph Culberson and Dennis Papp
  which is available from Joseph Culberson's Coloring Page
  http://web.cs.ualberta.ca/~joe/Coloring/lclindex.html (Copyright (c) 1997
  Joseph Culberson. All rights reserved.)

  Points to note:
  * The program accepts as input a DIMACS formatted graph colouring test file
  * Other optional command line settings can be viewed by running the programm
  from the command line with no arguments
  * Some of the parameters in this implementation have been fixed. See the
  publication:
